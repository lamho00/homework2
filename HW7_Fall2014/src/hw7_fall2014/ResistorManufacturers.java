  * Borg Conglomerate produces precision 1 kilo-Ohm resistors with a stated tolerance of 1% . 
  * However, the company has been losing sales to a new company Human Enterprise which produces the same resistor. 
  * To test whose resistors are better, each company produces a run of 100 resistors 
  * and submits them for testing. We will populate each array of resistors using a Random generator.
